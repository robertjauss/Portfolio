    <v-card-text class="text-body-1">
      <p>Born and raised in the central coast of California, entirely average throughout school, and graduated Monterey
      High School class of 2006. With no real plans for college, and no real ambitions for a career path, I opted
      to join the Army.</p>
      <p>A real challenge, both physically and mentally, and being tasked as a 35F Intelligence Analyst, I first found
      my passion for big data. Parsing through thousands of documents and reports to find only the information I
      needed, I finally found a challenging career path in something I had a knack for.</p>
      <p>During this time, I started tinkering more and more with web development. Starting with Macromedia Dreamweaver,
      and HTML 2.0, I had to learn the hard way. Over the years, things advanced and PHP and WordPress became the norm.
      Using those new technologies and frameworks helped me make websites for me, my friends, even the family pet, just
      to get practice in.</p>
      <p>After coming home from my assignment with the Special Forces Group in Okinawa, Japan, I started working up
      several jobs leading me to a career in technology, where I could put my computer, web, and data skills to use.
      Starting with Radio Shack, moving on to Best Buy, transitioning to Geek Squad doing computer repair, and finally
      getting my foot in the door at Intel Corporation in Folsom, California as an Enterprise SSD firmware execution
      technician.</p>
      <p>The environment, coworkers, challenges, and opportunities presented accelerated my skillset to new levels. I
      started my path on learning Python, starting with 2.7 as it was used heavily throughout Intel, but moving on to
      3 after starting my own side projects to learn faster. Discord bots, Telegram bots, home automation scripts,
      anything I could use Python for, I did.</p>
      <p>I got my skills in Python to the point the test development team wanted me. After learning all about regression
      testing on large codebases, I decided to put my web development skills to the test, and built a small dashboard
      for viewing the regression test results on one, easy to read page. My boss liked this, my boss's boss liked this,
      and fast forward 3 years and I'm not leading a team of developers to turn this small dashboard into a machine
      learning powerhouse for automatically reviewing logs and assigning Jira tickets.</p>
      <p>So that's my story so far. Where it goes from there, we'll see.</p>
