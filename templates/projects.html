  development at my current employer, Solidigm, which, for legal reasons, cannot be shown here.</p>

          <h5 class="text-h5 mb-6">Sheri Blossom &ndash; <a href="https://sheri.bot" target="_blank">Project Website</a></h5>
          <p>An online dashboard for an interactive, customizable Discord bot. I am the lead web developer on this team
            of 30+ volunteers. Website and Discord Bot are actively in use by approx. 1,786,808 users across 59,642
            Discord servers.</p>
          <p>Authorization is tied to your Discord account, utilizing OAUTH2. Data is stored in PostgreSQL, and fetched
          live by the bot using a Redis cache as a middleman to speed up transactions. Services running across 3
          separate VMs intercommunicating to process millions of user messages a day.</p>
          <p>The website is a combination of a Django backend, a REST API, PostgreSQL database, Redis cache, and Vue.js
            frontend with the Vuetify component library. The Discord bot itself is pure Python, utilizing the Discord.py
            library for connection to the Discord API. With tens of thousands of lines of code, this is by far the
            largest project I have helped create.</p>

          <p>A simple, stylized website solely designed to help people track their tool durability in
          the Nintendo Switch game Animal Crossing: New Horizons.</p>
          <p>Utilizing the same Django/Vue combination I've become increasingly proficient in, this website didn't
          quite challenge me so much as allow me to make something I could genuinely use, and figured others might want
          to use it as well. Starting off much more plain, I added a theme to match the style of the game itself
          to spruce it up.</p>

          <p>A web hosting company I run, with a frontend to allow customers to purchase domains, hosting, VPS, and
            colocation services, with everything (except colo, of course) provisioned automatically via Plesk.</p>
          <p>Running on my own hardware since 2016, there has been years of optimization dedicated to lowering downtime
          to zero and maintaining a robust backup system with a dedicated 12 TB JBOD serving 6 physical servers.</p>
