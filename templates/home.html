  <div style="max-width: 650px;" class="mx-auto">
    <h2 class="text-h2 mb-6">Hi there, I'm Robert.</h2>
    <p class="text-body-1">
      I've been doing web development and UI/UX design professionally for about ten years.
      and as a hobby for much longer. I've made small websites for individuals, portfolios, art galleries, and I've made
      dashboards for parsing through terabytes of data and comparing logs with machine learning.
    </p>
    <p class="text-body-1">
      It's not only something I like to think I'm good at, it's a hobby as well. What started out as a mere curiosity for
      how things worked, turned into the only career path I can see myself in. Web development, automation, and design are
      my passions. If you would like to see me put my passions to work for you, then let's chat.
